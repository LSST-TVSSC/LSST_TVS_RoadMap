Point Ia models from Shen et al. 2010

The directory name specifies the model, with the the first number being
the white dwarf core mass and the second number the shell mass
e.g., 1_0+0_10 => 1 Msun core mass, 0.1 Msun shell mass

optical_I5.mag gives the broadband lightcurves in vega magnitudes; the
column format is
t(days) M_bol  M_U  M_B  M_V  M_R  M_I  M_J  M_H  M_K
(note these are absolute magnitudes, multiplied by -1)

optical_I5.lc gives the lightcurves in ergs/sec, same format as above

The "spectra" directory gives the spectral time-series, with the file
name giving the time (in days) since explosion.  Format of the spectra
is

wavelength(angstroms)  L_lam(ergs/sec/angstrom)  Q  U  N

(Ignore the last three columns)
